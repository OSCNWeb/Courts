I was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1953. My parents moved to El Reno, Oklahoma from where I graduated high school in 1971. I graduated from the University of Central Oklahoma with a B.A. in Psychology. I then returned to University of Central Oklahoma and completed course work for Oklahoma teacher certification. Following several years of teaching elective science at Yukon High School, I returned to the University of Central Oklahoma and received a M.Ed. in Natural Science. My teaching career continued, while I entered Oklahoma City University Law School, from which I graduated in 1998, the same year I retired from teaching after 18 years. During 3 of my years in law school I was honored to be employed as a student clerk at the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, for the Honorable Charles Johnson. A job opened at the  Stephens County District Attorney's Office, where I work until I was fired after 7 years. During my time in the District Attorney's Office I was voted Assistant District Attorney of the Year for the State of Oklahoma, in 2001. I then entered private practice in Duncan, Oklahoma, taking family law and criminal cases. I was nominated for Special Judge in 2011, accepting the nomination in October of that year. I have been married to my childhood sweetheart for 43 years. I have two adult children, Jillian Glenn of Oklahoma City and Jarrett Herberger of Edmond. I now have two grandchildren Grayson and Deacon. I am a Christian that greatly enjoys Biblical study.
