I was raised in Yukon, Oklahoma from the age of six. I graduated from
Yukon High School in 1975. I received my undergraduate degree in
Business Administration from the University of Oklahoma in Norman,
Oklahoma in 1979. I received my Juris Doctor degree from Oklahoma City
University in 1982. After graduation I was in the general practice of
law for 25 years in Yukon. I was appointed to the bench in Canadian
County as a Special Judge in August of 2007. I previously served as a
Special Judge in Oklahoma City Municipal Court for 9 years and served as
an adjunct professor at OSU-OKC for several years.

I have been married to my wife Donna for 33 years and have four
daughters and two grandchildren.
