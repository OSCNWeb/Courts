I was born in Kermit, Texas on December 26, 1957. I am currently married
to LeAnn Hammontree and have one child, Olivia Hammontree (age 26). From
December of 1981 to August of 1982, I was a research and writing
assistant with the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals and a clerk for
Judge Tom Cornish of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals. I obtained
my Juris Doctorate from the University of Oklahoma in 1983. I had
received my B.B.A. in Accounting from the University of Oklahoma in
1980. Previous to my appointment to the bench, I practiced law in Enid,
Oklahoma, from October of 1983 to February of 2002. I was appointed as
the Associate District Judge of Grant County by Governor Frank Keating
in February of 2002, and I currently serve in that capacity and reside
in Medford, Oklahoma.
