Born in 1945, I am the son of a lawyer, a brother to two other lawyers
and the uncle to two nephews who are also attorneys.

I was raised in Chandler, Oklahoma. I received a Bachelor's degree from
Illinois College in Jacksonville, Illinois, in 1967. I graduated from
the University of Oklahoma College of Law in 1970 where I was a member
of the Order of the Coif and the Oklahoma Law Review.

I have lived in Bristow, Oklahoma for over 40 years. My hobbies include
the study of old manufacturing techniques, old locomotives, and John
Deere Tractors. While Marsha and I have no children, we have some of the
world's greatest nieces, nephews, God-children and their children.

I am serving my final term in office and am looking forward to a time
when "Reverse" will just be another gear in the car.
