I was born in Liberal, Kansas and raised in rural Beaver County,
Oklahoma. After graduating from Beaver High School I attended West Texas
A&M University and obtained a Bachelor's Degree in History. I thereafter
attended law school at the University of Oklahoma graduating in 1997. In
2000 Governor Frank Keating appointed me to serve as the Associate
District Judge of Texas County, Oklahoma. I served in that capacity
until 2011 when Governor Mary Fallin appointed me to serve as the
Associate District Judge of Beaver County, Oklahoma. I then moved home
bringing my wife, Kimmy, and our two daughters with me.

I enjoy hunting, fishing, Oklahoma football, spending time with family
and playing computer games with friends. I participate in my family's
farm and ranching operation. I love that my job allows to me help those
in my community most in need of assistance.
