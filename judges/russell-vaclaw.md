He is also a graduate of the University of Oklahoma College of Law.  

Judge Vaclaw lives in Bartlesville, OK, and is the proud father of three children.  He has been a member of different civic and charitable organizations, but he prefers coaching and managing his kidsâ€™ sports teams.  He has been a coach for each of his kids for over 12 years onward.  He has coached soccer, basketball, football, and tee-ball at one time or another. 

Judge Vaclaw is a frequent presenter in schools on the subject of cyber-bullying and the legal consequences of bullying.  His presentations have been made to students, parents, and educators in different school districts. 

Judge Vaclaw played a judge for the 2013 movie "To the Wonder" starring Ben Affleck, Rachel McAdams and Javier Bardem.  It was his first and last role in film.  The move was claimed by the Village Voice to be the worst movie ever!  Nonetheless, it will forever be in his professional "bio," and he has the pictures to prove it.
